        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus),
        originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of the most
        common
        and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though
        they
        are also kept as pets.[1]

        As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced
        annually
        for consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and egg
        production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social animals
        with
        complex vocalizations and behaviors, and feature prominently in folklore, religion, and literature across many
        societies. Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry and agriculture.

        Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the word chicken,[16] as in William
        Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[17] The
        usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[18] In older sources, and still often in
        trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[19]
